xl l.
4 August 1285

Eowano, by the grace of God, King of England, Lord of
Ireland, Duke of Aquitaine, to hrs beloved servant in
Christ, the Abbot of F aversham-Greeting. We have learnt
by the complaint of our Barons of Faversham that you,
according to a certain composition formerly made between
you and them, ought to find one man, on your behalf, for
the custody of our prison there at your eost, together with
a certain other manto be found for the same purpose by the
Barons aforesaid: You unjustlyâ€š to the great damage of
those Barons and contra to the aforesaid agreement, now
refuse to find any man lh that purpose, as you formerly
did: We, considering that for lack of guard of this kind
danger might be likely to accrue in the future, command you,
as we have several times commanded, firmly enjoining you,
that you cause to be provided the aforesaid man to guard
the prison aforesaid on your behalf, as you ought and have
been accustomed to do according to the aforesaid composi-
tion, and according to the tenor of our mandates aforesaid
frequently directed to you on that behalf : So that we need
not deservedly punish your fault in this matter, or that you
yourselves come before us wherever we may then be in
England within 15 days from the feast of Saint Michael
to reply to the aforenamed Barons why you be not bound to
provide one man for the custody of the prison aforesaid, and
to us why you have disdained to obey our mandates so
frequently directed to you on chat behalf, and that you
haye there this writ.

Witness myself, at Wolvemere, the fourth day of August
in the thirteenth year of our reign.
