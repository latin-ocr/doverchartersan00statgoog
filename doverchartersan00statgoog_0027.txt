xviii PREFACE

and although there is but small hope of adding many

other names to the list, it is doubtful whether any other
town in England can produce a fuller authentic record.

There are three words which occur in different
documents which seem to require some explanation—
Skomerfore on page 873 Lovecopsty on page 1793 and
Utviethis on page 264. Skomerfare occurs in Gower's

share of the plunder. I am inclined to think the latter is
the right local interpretation of the word, for the Warden,
as the Admiral of the Cinque Forte, always claimed at
least a share in the goods of pirates. The patent of

Henry Brook, Eighth Lord Cobham, as Warden of the
