Trra Krno to his beloved and faithful Stephen de Pencester,

Constable of his Caede of Dover and Warden of the
CinqueÎ‡ Ports-Greeting. As we have learnt from the
rsrrszsrlrsftfrsrkskssltslllkr
made between himselfand those Barons, to lind one man, at
his own eost, to guard our prison there, together witha
certain other man to be found for this purpose by the said
Barons: and although the same Abbot should have found,
according to the said composition, the aforesaid man to
guard the aforesaid prison, he nevertheless now wrongfully
refuses to do this. We, considering that for lack of guard
of this kind danger will be likely to accrue in the future,
command you [that you make inquisition into the plaint] of
the Barons aforesaid3 if you find it to be thus you will
cause the aforesaid Abbot to find the man aforesaid for the
custody of that prison as he ought, and was wont, to do in
times past, hythe aforesaid agreement.

Witness myself, at Gloucester, the fourth day of May in
the tenth year of our reign.
