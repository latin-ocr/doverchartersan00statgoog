PREFACE t

Tne various documenta contained in this volume,
with the exception of those included in the Appendices,
have been transcribed from the originale in the
possession of the Corporation of Dover. They cover
the period embraced between the years 1²²7 and 1569.
The large majority of them,as is natural, are of purely
local interest, but there are some which will be found
to possess historical importance, especially with reference
to the Cinque Ports. The document numbered XXVI.
is, so far as I know, the earliest record of the ancient
Court of Shepway, and afforda full information as to its
constitution, jurisdiction, and methods of procedure.
The manuscript consists of a double folio, and is
evidently the remains of the original Quaternus kept
by the Clerk of the Court. lt unfortunately throws
no light upon the vexcd question as to the locality in
which the Court was held. The oath of allegiance to
Hemy VIII. contained in XCIX. ie published in full,
I believe, for the first time. The various deeds have .
been printed in chronological order, but have been
arranged under suitable headings in the Contenta
columns; and, for the convenience of those who may
at any time wish to consult the originale, the reference
to the Corporation Archives is in every case given in
square brackets at the end of each document. One

Charter of the reign of Edwatd IV. has been omittcd;
