xiv PREFACE

it is a copy of that King's original Charter to the
Cinque Porta. As these documents have been fully
dealt with in Jeake's Charters, I did not consider it
necessary to print it here, although it was transcribed

In Appendices A and B will be found a full

received xlsh. for the confirmation of their Charter
in the Hundred Court of Dover. Looking at the

witnesses from this point of view, wc find the Constable,
the Seneschal, and the Clerk of the Constable (George,
