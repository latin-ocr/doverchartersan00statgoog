When it is understood that atate of a very small fraction
of a penny will enable this to be done,1 am more than
hopeful that the Corporation will be indueed to carry out
this meritorious work. Ihave thought it desirable to
include in this booka complete list of the different
records belonging to the town which still exist. It will
be found on the next page.

lwish to express my sincere thanks to the Rev. T.
Shipdem Frampton and Dr Sebastian Evans for their
most valuable assistance in preparing this work, and to
Mr Jeakes‚ of the Manuscript Department of the British
Muscam, for the unselhsh labour he bestowed in reading
the proof sheets. Iam also much indebted to Mr H.
Gibson for the excellent photograph from which the
frontispiece was made.
