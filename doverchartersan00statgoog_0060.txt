5 August 1ae5.

Eowano, by the grace of God‚ King of England, Lord of
lreland, and Duke of Aquitaine, to his beloved servant in
Christ, the Abbot of Faversham-Grceting. Forasmuch as
we have learnt from the complaint of our Barons of F avers-
ham that you and your bailiffs of Faversham grievously
distrain our Barons for the performance to you of undue
and unaccustomed services, and that you, contrary toa
certain composition formerly entered into between you and
them, frequently vex and unjustly oppress them to ‘the
grievous and weighty hurt of these Barons : We, unwilling
that you should injure these Barons on this behalf‚ com-
mand you, as we have often commanded, firmly enlioining
you, that you entirely desist henceforth from ev ing
exactions and undue distraints of this kind on the afore-
said Barons, and cause your bailiffs to desist3 observing
the said agreement according to the tenor thereof, as shall
be just, according to the tenor of our other commanda which
on that behalf you have received: and that you cease the
distraint made upon them on the aforesaid plea without
delay, so that a second complaint on that account shall not
again reach us 3 or that you yourselves be before us wherever
{tithlltthttfttltt tlltl tlttf‘t {lifttttl
exactione and distraints aforesaid, and (to answer) td us
wherefore you have delayed carrying out our frequent
mandates directed to you on that behalf : And you have
there this writ.

Witness myself, at Wolvemere, the fifth day of August
in the thirteenth year of our reign.
